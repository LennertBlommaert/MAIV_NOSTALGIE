                  the attention of the acclaimed director. Mesmerized by her beauty, Fellini immediatly wrote an
                  extra role out for her. She would play as a friend of Marcello - the main character - as herself as Fellini
                  found that her own character was most interesting as it was.

                  Dylan stayed at Vernilya for more than a week, finishing many of the songs that would appear

                  it for her album, Chelsea Girl, released in 1967.

                  Warhol took her in at the Factory and Nico became a Warhol Superstar. These Superstars were unique

                    to the film of her singing with the Velvet Underground at the Factory, she also went on to appear in
                    The Chelsea Girls and Imitation of Christ which was originally part of **** (Four Stars) or the twenty-five
                     hour movie. Warhol also used her voice as the soundtrack for Sunset - which he shot in 1967.

                  Nico was introduced to the avant-garde rock band The Velvet Underground by Andy Warhol,
                  who was its manager at the time.
                  At Warhol’s insistence, Nico sang with the band on three songs of their debut album,
                  The Velvet Underground & Nico.
                  The songs were specially tuned for Nico’s deadpen voices wich propelled the songs.

                  At the time it was not a huge succes,but it is now widely considered one of the most

                  of all time.

                  During the 1960s, both Nico and Leanord Cohen were both fringe figures in Andy Warhol’s “Factory” crowd.
                  Warhol speculated that Cohen had spent many time listening to Nico in clubs and that this had
                  influenced his musical style a lot.
                  Especially Chelsea Girl greatly influenced him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nico also repeatedly spurned Cohen’s advances - preferring younger men - wich resulted
                  in Cohen writing songs about her: “Memories”, “Joan Of Arc,” “Take This Longing,”
                  and “One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong” are all inspired by Nico
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, it was Cohen who introduced Nico to her signature instrument:
                  the harmonium. His first impressions of her was that she looked like “the perfect Aryan ice queen”.
                  He followed her all around New York.

                  During her relationship with Garrel Nico started using heroin, wich she was addicted to

                <p>
                  Nico’s first acting appearance with Garrel occurred in his 1972 film, La Cicatrice Intérieure.
                  Nico also supplied the music for this film, among others. and collaborated very closely with the director.

                  Nico briefly toured as supporting act for the Proto-gothic rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees.
                  Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of many post-punk bands who admired Nico.

                <p>
                  Nico’s album the marble index is sometimes described as “the first Goth album”.
                  With its stark sound, somber lyrics, and Nico’s deliberate change in her look,
                  the album became a crucial music and visual prototype for the gothic rock movement.
                  Gothic rock also creates a dark atmosphere by drawing influence from the drones used by the Velvet Underground.

                    her methadone dependency had diminished and her songwriting  had increased when she
                    took her grown son, Ari, on holiday to the Spanish island of Ibiza.
